      <p>For this guide, I will be using a Windows environment. The purpose of this guide is to teach you how to use the Yahoo API, so I will not go in-depth on how to set up your development environment.</p>
      <h4>Installing WAMP onto your windows environment:</h4>
      <p>WAMP is a full development stack that you can install on your windows machine. This package lets you use Apache, Php, and MySql on your windows machine. The download and installation instructions can be found <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">here</a>. Note: If you have a program that is already listening to localhost port 80, you need to configure WAMP to listen to a different port, such as .8383. </p>
      <p>After you have everything set up, you should be able to create a PHP project folder in WAMP's WWW folder. You will know WAMP is up and running by checking the system tray. </p>
