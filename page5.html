        Earlier in this How-To guide, we said that a limitation of the Yahoo API was that it could only return stock quotes on specified stocks. A possible workaround can be to get a list of all the stock symbols <a href="http://eoddata.com/symbols.aspx">here</a>. You can parse the webpage for the stock symbols, then use the Yahoo API to get your stock quotes.

        However, this workaround is not a scalable solution. For a solution that is more efficient, you have to use a paid option. Such as one that can be found <a href="http://eoddata.com/products/webservice.aspx">here</a>. Integrating a paid solution is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
